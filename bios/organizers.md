Team bio for the URSP organizers
--------------------------------

[Remy Joseph](https://remyjoseph.wordpress.com/) got his [PhD](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/260467?ln=en) from EPFL in Lausanne (Switzerland) in 2018. He arrived at Princeton in December 2018 to work on  [LSST](http://lsst.org/), and [WFIRST](http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/). His main mission is to combine different datasets at different depth and resolution to improve the deblending of overlapping galaxies. At night, he wears a cape and uses his super-power: strong gravitational lensing to find his elusive nemesis: Lord dark matter. 
In between the two Remy enjoys practicing various sports: hiking, soccer, skiing (cross-country), running, bouldering and most of all fencing. 

Andy Goulding received his [PhD](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PhDT.......223G) from Durham University (UK) in 2010. He was a Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from 2010-2014, and came to Princeton in the fall of 2014. His research focuses on the demographics of active galactic nuclei, and observations of the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. He is the Chair of the Extragalactic Working Group for the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. This is his 5th year co-organizing the USRP. His outside interests include competitive running and triathlons, skiing, diving and cinema.

Peter Melchior got his [PhD](http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/10954/) from Heidelberg University (Germany) in 2010, was a [CCAPP Fellow](http://ccapp.osu.edu) at the Ohio State University from 2011 - 2015, and came to Princeton in the fall of 2015.
His research interests are in observational cosmology, particularly the high-precision measurements necessary for [weak gravitational lensing](http://pmelchior.net/research_des_sv_clusters.html), and astrostatistics.
He has been or is working on various surveys: [DES](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), [LSST](http://lsst.org/), and [WFIRST](http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
Outside work, he enjoys practicing Aikido, skiing, wind surfing, music and the
arts.

Rachael Beaton received her PhD in 2014 at the University of Virginia. She then moved to Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, CA before beginning a Hubble and Carnegie-Princeton Fellowship at Princeton in 2017. Her primary research program aims to sharpen the tools used for distance measurement in the Local Universe. She focuses on those tools that will be most relevant with future infrared focused facilities (Extremely Large Telescopes, WFIRST, JWST) and that, once sharpened, can be used to answer questions relevant to cosmology — from the local expansion rate of the Universe to the three-dimensional structure of very nearby galaxies. Outside of astronomy, she will usually be outside performing whatever activity matches the local weather conditions. 

Adrian Price-Whelan grew up in Connecticut before moving to New York City for his undergraduate (BA, NYU) and graduate (PhD, Columbia) degrees, where he also played guitar and/or bass in a few bands ([like this one](https://operatormusicband.bandcamp.com/)). His research focuses on the structure and dynamics of stars within our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and so has been busy digesting the recent [data release 2 of the *Gaia* mission](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr2). Adrian is also a core contributor to the [Astropy core package](github.com/astropy/astropy) and [Astropy project](astropy.org) more broadly, and is the deputy lead in charge of the units and coordinates subpackages. He also enjoys biking, open-source software development, whisky, and photography.

Mathew Madhavacheril's worldline has taken him through Kuwait, India and the UK before he attended graduate school at Stony Brook University where he completed his PhD in Physics.  Mat works on observational cosmology and likes thinking of ways to test and constrain fundamental physics using the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. When he isn't modding Skyrim or sending Kerbals to the Mün, Mat enjoys hiking, cycling and consuming science fiction.

Timothy Morton grew up in Columbus, OH and received his [PhD](http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/8024/) from Caltech in 2013, after which he moved to Princeton. His research focus is on understanding the demographics of exoplanet systems, and he has done a
lot of work in particular regarding [distinguishing true planets from astrophysical false positives](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/science/kepler-planets-nasa.html?_r=0) for the Kepler
mission.  This is his fourth year helping to organize the URSP.  His [wife](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~verag/) is a
cosmologist at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/), and they have a 4 year-old son
named [Andrej](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAIhtf77jD0) and a 5-month old daughter named Zoe.  Outside astronomy, data science, and family, his interests
include playing piano, choral music, and sports involving running, balls, or
flying discs.

Noah Notis is from Allentown, PA. He likes gardening and has found a new appreciation for breadbaking during the pandemic. Noah is a rising junior in the Physics department, and is really excited about learning more astrophysics this Summer. Noah will be working with Phillip Mocz simulating how dark matter haloes would look like if the Dark Matter particle is the axion. Noah is excited to learn more about dark matter and do research in this fascinating subject. 

Hello my name is Majid I am a senior at the Colorado School of Mines Studying Physics Engineering. I have ambitions of earning a PhD in Physics or Astrophysics with an emphasis superconducting sensors used for cosmological research. I have also had an obsession with quantum engineering recently.

Jessica Stikons grew up in Ringoes, NJ and is currently a rising sophomore at Princeton University. She recently declared her major as Operations Research and Financial Engineering, and intends on receiving a certificate in finance. She is currently working as an Astrophysics Research Intern through the USRP program at Princeton University, and will be researching the risk and likelihood of large space weather events.
