Hello there

Vivek Vijayakumar recieved this git repository on May 31, 2022. He then had to push this edited paragraph on the same day. Quite unfortunate.

Xander Jenkin is a rising sophomore at Princeton University (class of 2025) studying Astrophysics. He is from Florida and has seen multiple alligators, having wrestled one himself (a ritual which every Florida Man must do upon reaching adulthood). He watches the anime.
