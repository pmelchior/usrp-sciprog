Hello there

Vivek Vijayakumar recieved this git repository on May 31, 2022. He then had to push this edited paragraph on the same day. Quite unfortunate.

Andrew Horne recently graduated from Delaware State University, with a degree in Engineering Physics with a concentration in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Mathematics. 

Xander Jenkin is a rising sophomore at Princeton University (class of 2025) studying Astrophysics. He is from Florida and has seen multiple alligators, having wrestled one himself (a ritual which every Florida Man must do upon reaching adulthood). He watches the anime.




My name is Ameen Zerrad. I am 21 from Dover Delaware and I go to college at Delaware State University.  Growing up I liked to play sports and read books. Currently, I am at Princeton University for a Summer internship in the Astro\o-physics department. Iâ€™m excited to be here!
