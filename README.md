# Princeton Undergraduate Summer Research Program in Astrophysics

This repo contains information about the USRP at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, foremost material for its first week course "Intro to Scientific Programming", aka *bootcamp*.

The plan for the first week is to give you an overview of good things to know when it comes to scientific computing, give you time to do some hands-on exercises, and provide resources for you to learn more. We aim to cover basic unix commands and remote login (ssh), software version control (git and github), the Python programming language and scientific programming stack, and basic statistics. Given that we only have a week, we will only scratch the surface on each of these topics, but many of us will be around and willing (physically or via email/Slack) to provide support and additional guidance throughout the summer.

**Before you start, please make sure that you have all necessary software installed on your personal machine *before* we start the bootcamp. To help you along the way, have a look at [these instructions](SETUP-INSTALLATION.md).**

For live questions of general interest to the "camp masters" and to keep in touch with your fellow campers, please subscribe to the slack channels (details sent via email, or ask your camp master/mentor) .

## Schedule of the Bootcamp

* Day 1 - unix commands, version control (github), ssh setup
* Day 2 - python and numpy
* Day 3 - statistical data analysis, linear fitting, and astropy
* Day 4 - optimization and non-linear fitting


All sessions take place virtually on zoom. **The agenda for each days is detailed in the respective README files**, but in general every day looks roughly like this (all times Eastern):


* 09:30-10:30 Course 1
* 10:30-11:00  Astro Coffee (ask for zoom and slack channel)
* 11:00-12:00  Course 2
* 12:00-13:00  Lunch
* 13:00-14:30  Course 3
* 14:30-15:00 Break
* 15:00-17:00  Course 4 / Open time
