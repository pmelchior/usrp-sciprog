Edited!Student-led discussion prompts:

* Explain something you've recently learned about scientific programming (in the broad sense; maybe a Python trick, maybe a command-line tool, maybe an organizational app, etc.), and why you've found it useful.

* Give a summary of a recent [astrobites](http://astrobites.org) post or astro-ph paper (or other cool science) you found interesting.

* Describe a recent situation where you were confused about something, and then figured it out. (odds are you won't be the only one to be confused about this same thing!)

* Describe a small feature of your everyday research routine that you just couldn't do without and that you think others might find helpful/useful.
    * Previous examples from 2015:
      * ctl + a, ctl + e, ctl + k, ctl + y in terminal/emacs/other things
      * In Sublime Text, you can overwrite all instances of a variable using `ctl + f -> alt + enter`
      * in terminal `ctl + r` look through history of commands
      * how to make aliases: e.g. `alias computer="ssh -X user@computer.astro.princeton.edu"` --> put this in your `~/.bash_profile` file.
      * `ls -ltrh` 
      * Don't underestimate the productivity increase from more screen space. 
        * on linux department machines-- you can switch desktops with `ctl + alt + <arrow keys>`
      * `screen` program!  look it up.
      * `tramp` in emacs-- allows you to edit files remotely even without (explicitly) logging on to remote machine.
      * `history-search-backward`: lets you search through previously typed commands at the prompt level
      * You can change the `PS1` environment variable to make your shell prompt look different
      * `history` lists previous commands; you can then execute `!123` (for example) to re-execute line 123 from your history.
      * `touch <filename>` creates a blank file that didn't exist before.
      * `zip` to iterate over multiple things at once in python
      * `enumerate` is useful in python!
      * code editors
        * TextWrangler
        * SublimeText (recommended!)
