Student-led discussion prompts:

* Explain something you've recently learned about scientific programming (in the broad sense; maybe a Python trick, maybe a command-line tool, maybe an organizational app, etc.), and why you've found it useful.
    
  * For finding points near other points when you have lots of points: KD-tree!  

* Give a summary of a recent [astrobites](http://astrobites.org) post or astro-ph paper (or other cool science) you found interesting.

    * Talked about how the Fermi telescope works to detect gamma rays. 
    * Uranus has clouds/weather (sometimes!)

* Describe a recent situation where you were confused about something, and then figured it out. (odds are you won't be the only one to be confused about this same thing!)

  * Tried to print a big image with standard buffered image Java library and ran into maximum integer for large image! (might try to fix with PNGJ-- more optimized for large images; won't crash) 

* Describe a small feature of your everyday research routine that you just couldn't do without and that you think others might find helpful/useful.
  * ctl + a, ctl + e, ctl + k, ctl + y in terminal/emacs/other things
  * In Sublime Text, you can overwrite all instances of a variable using `ctl + f -> alt + enter`
  * in terminal `ctl + r` look through history of commands
  * how to make aliases: e.g. `alias computer="ssh -X user@computer.astro.princeton.edu"` --> put this in your `~/.bash_profile` file.
  * `ls -ltrh` 
  * Don't underestimate the productivity increase from more screen space. 
    * on linux department machines-- you can switch desktops with `ctl + alt + <arrow keys>`
  * `screen` program!  look it up.
  * `tramp` in emacs-- allows you to edit files remotely even without (explicitly) logging on to remote machine.
  * `history-search-backward`: let's you search through previously typed commands at the prompt level
