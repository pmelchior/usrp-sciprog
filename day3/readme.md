# Day 3: Linear fitting and the Hubble expansion

## Schedule

* 10:30 - 11:00  Astro coffee in Grand Central (Peyton)
* 11:00 - 12:30  Fitting a Line and intro to `astropy`
* 12:30 - 14:00  Lunch
* 14:00 - 14:30  
* 14:30 - 15:30  
* 15:30 - 17:00  

We start with a crash course on statistical data analysis by [fitting a line to data](Fitting-a-line.ipynb), have a [brief look at `astropy`](Astropy-Demo.ipynb) for its use of physical units and coordinates, and then bring it all together by reproducing the work of Edwin Hubble and estimating the [expansion velocity of the universe](Hubble.ipynb).
