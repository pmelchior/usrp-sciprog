# Day 3: Linear fitting and the Hubble expansion

## Schedule

* 10:30 - 11:00 Astro Coffee (Peyton)
* 11:00 - 12:30 Fitting a Line and intro to `astropy`
* 12:30 - 14:00 Lunch break
* 14:00 - 15:30 Introduction to Optimization and Photometry
* 15:30 - 16:00 Coffee break
* 16:00 - 17:00 Fitting a transient light curve

We start with a crash course on statistical data analysis by [fitting a line to data](Fitting-a-line.ipynb), have a [brief look at `astropy`](Astropy-Demo.ipynb) for its use of physical units and coordinates, and then bring it all together by reproducing the work of Edwin Hubble and estimating the [expansion velocity of the universe](Hubble.ipynb).

We will then continue with an [introduction to optimization](Newton-Method.ipynb) and an introduction to the most basic of all astronomical measurements: [photometry](transit/Photometry.ipynb). We will then combine these two to fit a [transient exoplanet signal](transit/Transit.ipynb) in the light curve of a star.
