    "## The Bayesian approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review what we did so far. We found that standard weighted least squares fitting is a justified approach to estimating the best-fit parameters because it optimizes the likelihood of the data under the assumptions of our model; it optimizes a _justified scalar objective function_. We then fit our straight-line model to the data using and got back a point-estimate of the best parameters along with a covariance matrix describing the uncertainties in the parameters. This is the way of the _frequentist_. What we're going to do now is see what happens if we switch to a Bayesian methodology instead. While the two methods end up looking mathematically identical, there are fundamental philosophical differences that can lead to very different interpretations and implementations when models are more complex than the toy example we use above. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Bayesians, we aren't interested in a point-estimate of the best parameters, but rather we're interested in the inferred distribution of possible parameter values (the _posterior probability distribution function_ over parameters). So how do we write down or solve for this posterior pdf? Before we get to that, let's take a look at a fundamental equation of Bayesian statistics, [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem), which we'll derive using the joint probability of $A$ and $B$ which are conditional on some other information $I$ that, right now, we don't care about. For example, $A$ could be the time it takes to get from here to NYC, $B$ could be the amount of traffic on the road, and $I$ could include the information that we're driving a car and not walking. Bayes' theorem as expressed below is not controversial -- Bayesians and Frequentists agree that this is just how joint and conditional probabilities work. We start by writing down the joint probability of $A$ and $B$, then factor it in two ways into conditional proabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A,B \\,|\\, I) = p(A\\,|\\,B, I)\\,p(B\\,|\\, I) = p(B\\,|\\,A, I)\\,p(A \\,|\\, I)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we look at the right two expressions, and divide by one of the marginal probabilities to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A\\,|\\,B, I) = \\frac{p(B\\,|\\,A, I)\\,p(A \\,|\\, I)}{p(B\\,|\\, I)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so that's all fine. Now let's replace $A$ and $B$ with variables that represent, from our example above, our data $D=(\\{x_n\\},\\{y_n\\},\\{\\sigma_n\\})$ and our model parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\,|\\,D, I) = \\frac{p(D\\,|\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, I)\\,p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\,|\\, I)}{p(D\\,|\\, I)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In just switching the meaning of the variables, this expression becomes controversial! Frequentists would object to the above for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The term on the left hand side is a probability over parameters given the data (the _posterior_ pdf) $p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\,|\\,D, I)$. This is something that a frequentist would say cannot exist - there is only one true vector of parameters that we are trying to learn, not a distribution!\n",
    "2. The right-most term in the numerator is a probability over parameters _with no dependence on the data_ (the _prior_ pdf). This encapsulates all of our prior knowledge about the parameters before we did the experiment and observed some data. This is perhaps the aspect of Bayesian inference that frequentists most disagree with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The differences above result from the fact that probability means something different to Frequentists and Bayesians. Bayesians think of probability as representing a _degree of belief_ about something, whereas a frequentist thinks of a probability as related to _limiting frequencies of occurrence_ in repeated trials or observations. This is a rich topic and I highly recommend reading [this series of blogposts](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/) by Jake Vanderplas to learn more. For now, let's put on Bayesian hats and take a look at the implications of the expression above.\n",
    "\n",
    "(_It's good to rememeber that we're all friends. The differences are based on philosophy and so can lead to some heated discussions and debates, but remember we're all trying to do science -- we're on the same team!_)"

We've already seen this object and used it above to find the best-fit model parameters by maximizing this function. In a Bayesian context, it can also be thought of as a distribution -- it's a distribution that generates new datasets given a model instance. For that reason, we typically refer to models that produce a likelihood as _generative models_ because they specify how to  generate new data sets that look like the one you observe. As we saw above when we wrote the likelihood function for a straight line model and data with Gaussian errors, the likelihood usually contains a component that can be interpreted as the _noise model_.\n",

This flexibility is what makes the prior a somewhat controversial object. In practice, the prior only really matters if it is much narrower than the likelihood function. If the prior is broad with respect to the likelihood, the information in the likelihood makes the prior almost irrelevant. However, there are several subtleties to choosing priors that need to be considered. As an example, one subtlety comes from the choice of coordinates for the model parameters: a prior that is broad and flat in a parameter $\\alpha$ won't be broad and flat if you change variables to $\\beta = \\alpha^2$. \n",

If you'd like to propagate the posterior pdf (as in, pass on to other scientists to use your results), what do you do if the posterior pdf isn't analytic?

A disadvantage to these methods comes from the \"Markov Chain\" part of the name: there is always some correlation between nearby steps in a chain of samples, so you have to compute second-order statistics on the samples to try to verify whether your samples are truly random or fair samples from the target distribution (your posterior pdf).\n",

    "We clearly get a biased result and yet _very_ precise measurements of the parameters when we don't take in to account the intrinsic scatter. What we need to do now is modify out model to include the scatter as a free parameter. Unfortunately, it enters the model non-linearly so there is no solution using linear algebra or least-squares. Instead, we just write a new likelihood function and optimize it numerically. One choice we'll make is to use the parameter $\\ln{V}$ instead of $V$ for reasons I'll explain later. To implement the new model, we'll subclass our `StraightLineModel` class and define new likelihood and prior functions.\n",

    "Subclass the `StraightLineModel` class and implement new prior and likelihood functions (`ln_prior` and `ln_likelihood`). The our model will now have 3 parameters: `a`, `b`, and `lnV` the log of the intrinsic scatter variance. Use flat priors on all of these parameters. In fact, we'll be even lazier and forget the constant normalization terms: if a parameter vector is within the ranges below, return 0. (log(1.)) otherwise return -infinity:\n",
