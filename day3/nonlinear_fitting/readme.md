# Day 4: Non-linear Fitting

- 9:30 - 10:30: Introduction to Optimization
- 10:30 - 11:00: Astro coffee
- 11:00 - 12:00: Introduction to Photometry
- 12:00 - 13:00: Lunch
- 13:00 - 14:30: Fitting a transient light curve
- 14:30 - 15:00: Break
- 15:00 - 17:00: Discussion & open time

  We will start with an [introduction to optimization](Newton-Method.ipynb) and an introduction to the most basic of all astronomical measurements: [photometry](transit/Photometry.ipynb). We will then combine these two to fit a [transient exoplanet signal](transit/Transit.ipynb) in the light curve of a star.
