# Day 1 checklist

1. Get familiar with the university machines (e.g., adroit). See [Princeton Research Computing](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems/tiger)

2. Do the following from from a terminal (on both laptop and adroit):
    * Create a new directory
    * Navigate between directories
    * List the contents of a directory
    * List all the contents of a directory matching a given pattern (e.g., all files with names ending with '.py')
    * Create a blank file with a given name.
    * Open a '.py' file with your favorite text editor supporting syntax highlighting/formatting (e.g., vim, emacs, SublimeText, Atom, etc.)
    * Delete a file
    * Delete a directory and all its contents (Be careful with this one!)
    * Rename a file/directory
    * Use `ssh` to log on to your department computer from your laptop.  This will require [setting up an "ssh key"](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/docs/SSH#Keys).
    * Use `scp` to do both of the following:
        * transfer a single file between your laptop and your department computer.
        * transfer an entire directory & its contents between your laptop and your department computer.
    * Understand the concept of "environment variables" and how to set them, both temporarily and permanently.  Especially understand what the `PATH` variable represents.

3. Be comfortable with the following basic git/Github skills (we will practice these together with the "team bio" exercise):
    * Understand what the terms 'repository', 'clone', 'fork', 'commit', 'push', 'pull', 'merge' mean
    * Create a new repository on Github
    * Fork someone else's repository from Github
    * Clone an existing repository to your local computer.
    * Add new files to a repository
    * Change existing files, commit those changes locally, and push those changes to Github.
    * Pull changes that other people have made onto your local repository.

4. Install [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your personal computer and get familiar with [environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
