# Software management: version control with `git`

Version control is a technique that allows to keep track of all the changes in a complex software or in a complex document within a large collaboration. 

In order to be able to manage your own software or documentation, you need first to open an account on one of the two popular Open Source servers [GitHub](https://github.com) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org). For today, open your account on BitBucket, because we are going to use it.

Once it is done, visit the BitBucket page of the `RAMSES` code [here](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses). 

You can see among other things the source code, a Wiki that contains the user's guide and an automatic test page. 

Go to your Terminal window on `adroit` and type:

 ```console
git clone https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses
```

This will clone the entire code repository to your account on adroit. You can look at the history of the repository using:

```console
git log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short

What you can do with git:
- track bugs to their authors
- edit users guides and wikis
- revert to older versions
- track the exact version of the code with the Git hash key 
- set up an automatic build and test system
- validation and verification (reproducibility)
