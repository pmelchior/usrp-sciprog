# Visualizing the simulation results

We will now run our first simulation. In principle, we have compiled the code for `NDIM=1` without MPI, obtaining in the `ramses/bin` directory the executable called `ramses1d`. 

In order to use it, we need a parameter file. There are plenty of examples in directory `ramses/namelist`. In the Terminal window, type the following:
```
pwd
```
It should reply this:
```
/home/your_login_name/ramses
```
Otherwise, go to the correct folder using comand `cd`. Then type:
```
bin/ramses1d namelist/tube1d.nml
```

You should see the program running and outputting a load of data to screen. It is more convenient to redirect the standard output from the screen to a file. For this, type:

```
bin/ramses1d namelist/tube1d.nml > run.log
```

This create a new file called `run.log` that you can store for later and examine by typing:

```
more run.log
```
It should start with:

```

If you see the same output, you are good. If not, then something went wrong in the previous steps and you should try again.

We will now try and visualize the results using a nice plotting routine.

First we try with `python`. For this, you can use two options to launch a `jupyter notebook`.

- use again [myadroit](https://myadroit.princeton.edu), selecting this time the option **Jupyter Notebook**.
- use a more complex but more powerful technique based on a SSH tunnel from one of `adroit` compute nodes. In the Terminal window on `adroit` type:
```
salloc -n 1 -t 01:00:00
```
It should reply this"
```
salloc: Granted job allocation 1776094
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes adroit-h11n6 are ready for job
```
You are in the compute node for one hour. Now type in the same Terminal window:

```
module load anaconda3/2021.5
jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=1234 --ip=0.0.0.0
```
Open a Terminal window **on your laptop** and type:
```
ssh -N -f -L 1234:adroit-h11n6:1234 your_login_name@adroit.princeton.edu
```
The Terminal window on `adroit` must have produced some text output. Copy the last line Web address to your Web browser. It should look like this one:
```
http://127.0.0.1:1234/?token=9590a9d7cb1d618e9f0b8cb4cfe5f588fd8f997dd9b90c69
```
It should open a Jupyter Notebook on `adroit`. In this Jupyter Notebook, type the following cells:
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from astropy.io import ascii
```
```
!grep -n Output run.log > /tmp/out.txt
lines = ascii.read("/tmp/out.txt")
i = int(lines["col1"][-1][:-1])
n = int(lines["col3"][-1])
```
```
data = ascii.read("run.log",header_start=i-2,data_start=i-1,data_end=i+n-1)  
```
```
plt.plot(data["x"],data["d"])
```

You should see the density profile of this famous 1D test called Sod's test. Note that you may have to import the following packages for this example to work: `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `astropy`. 

We can do the same using the `gnuplot` package directly within the Linux operating system. For this, type in the Terminal window on `adroit`:
```
gnuplot
```
You are now inside the `gnuplot` program. You can now type:
```
gnuplot> plot "run.log" every ::::1000 u 2:3 title "initial density"
gnuplot> replot "run.log" every ::1000 u 2:3 title "final density"
```
You should see two density profiles, one corresponding to the initial conditions and the final one, similar to what you got using `python`. 

The real power of `gnuplot` is that it can be used directly on the command line. For example, after having first exited `gnuplot`, type directly in the Terminal window:

```
gnuplot -e "set term jpeg; plot 'run.log' every ::1000 u 2:3 title 'final density' " > density.jpeg
```
This will create an image called `density.jpeg` that you can see using your Web browser on `adroit`.
