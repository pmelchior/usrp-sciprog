### Work Session #1

Work with your group to classify the object in your dataset.

### Technical Lesson: Non-Linear Fitting

Learn how to fit a non-linear function from a quick intro to [Newton's method](Newton-Method.ipynb) for optimization, and then employ methods from `spicy.optimize`.

### Work Session #2 
Work with your group to measure the properties of the object in your dataset and prepare your iPython notebook to present.

### Presentations & Wrap Up
